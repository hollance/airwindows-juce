# Airwindows in JUCE

This repo contains selected [Airwindows plug-ins](https://github.com/airwindows/airwindows) ported to JUCE, mainly as a way to study how they work because I'm not nearly as smart as Chris and I want to understand his voodoo.

NOTE: This is just the source code. If you want an actual VST or AU file, you will need to build it yourself using [JUCE](https://juce.com). However, it's much easier to [download the plug-ins from airwindows.com](https://www.airwindows.com). Also be sure to [support Chris on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/airwindows) for his original work!
